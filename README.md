# Mold Risk Index Integration

## Features

Calculate the risk of mold in a not heated confined space, like an unventilated [crawl space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crawl_space), only taking the temperature and humidity in count.

Here you normally have colder temperatures (in my part of the world) than inside your house most time of the year, and no surfaces that is much colder than the air inside. This means you can allow a higher humidity without the risk of mold. This integration can also be used for a not heated garage or attic for example.

For spaces that are heated and where the risk of mold is close to cold surfaces (like in a bathroom) you should use the ["Mold Indicator"](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mold_indicator/).
The formulas for the "Mold Risk Index” is inspired by a forum thread in a Swedish house building forum at [byggahus.se](https://www.byggahus.se/forum/threads/formel-foer-riskkurva.311612). Which in turn are originating (among others) from a publication by Hannu Viitanen named ["Factors affecting mould growth on kiln dried wood"](https://cris.vtt.fi/en/organisations/vtt-technical-research-centre-of-finland/publications/). *Search the net and you will find the publication*

The risk of mold according to these formulas looks like this:

## Installation

### HACS

Install via [HACS][hacslink] (Home Assistant Community Store)

1. Go to HACS -> Integrations -> "+ Explore & Download Repos",  or click the badge if you have My Home Assistant activated:  
[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.][mybadgehacs]][mylinkhacs]
1. Find "Mold Risk Index".
1. Open the search result and click "Download this Repository with HACS".

### Manual

1. Using your tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
1. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
1. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `mold_risk_index`.
1. Download _all_ the files from this repository.
1. Place the files you downloaded in the `mold_risk_index` directory you created.
1. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

1. In the Home Assistant UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" and click "+" and search for "Mold Risk Index", or click the badge if you have My Home Assistant activated:  
[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.][mybadge]][mylink]
1. Choose a name for the sensors.
1. Choose a temperature and a humidity sensor to use for the calculations.

>_If you want to add more sensors, just go through the configuration steps again._

## Usage

Use the `Limit` sensor to set the level on a dehumidifier, or compare it with the actual humidity and start a dehumidifier when the humidity is getting close the limit.</p>

The `Risk Index` sensor can be used for tracking historical data.

- At level 1 mold will start grow after 8 weeks or more.
- At level 2 mold will start grow in 4 to 8 weeks.
- At level 3 mold will start grow in less than 4 weeks.
